Peter studies the theory of relational databases. Table in the relational database consists of values that
are arranged in rows and columns.123134 138991 21321abhhsc 123320
There are different normal forms that database may adhere to. 123Normal forms are designed to
minimize the redundancy of data in the database. For example, 231a database table for a library might
have a row for each book and columns for book name, book author, 3123and author's email.
If the same author wrote several books, then this representation is clearly redundant. To formally
define this kind of redundancy Peter has introduced his own normal form. A table is in Peter's Normal
Form (PNF) if and only if there is no pair of rows and a pair of columns such that the values in the
corresponding columns are the same for both rows.
